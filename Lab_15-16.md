# **Experiment - 15 & 16**  

*Write shell scripts to print system information and perform basic mathematical calculations. Use redirection operators to store the output of commands.*  
#
### **Approach**  
Create shell scripts using `#!/bin/bash`. Use system commands to fetch system information and `expr` or `bc` for calculations. Redirect output using `>` and `>>`.
