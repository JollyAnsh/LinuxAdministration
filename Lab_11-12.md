# **Experiment - 5**  

*Create the `operator1` user and confirm that it exists in the system. Set the password for `operator1`. Create additional users `operator2` and `operator3`, set their passwords, update the comments for `operator1` using `usermod -c`, and remove the `operator3` user from the system.*  
#
### **Approach**  
Use `useradd` to create users, `passwd` to set passwords, `cat /etc/passwd` to verify user existence, `usermod -c` to update user comments, and `userdel` to remove users.

### **Syntax**
